# API GraphQL

A simple GraphQL API using Apollo Server, Mongoose, type-graphql and Typescript.

### Initial configuration

First, you'll need to install the dependencies using your preferred package manager.
You can run either `yarn` or `npm install`.

Go to the _.env.example_, create a _.env_ file with the same fields – or duplicate and rename the file to _.env_ – and put your database URL and the port you want to serve the API.

You now are free to send queries and mutations through the playground available on the API, or send requests through your front-end application.
